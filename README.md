- Developed automated Power BI analytics pipelines and statistical reports that improved interpretability and reduced manual analysis time by 30%, while contributing to relational/NoSQL data-model design and ETL best practices.
- Collaborated with cross-functional researchers to present findings, refine requirements, and document datasets and models supporting reproducible analytics and data-driven decision making.

**Data Engineer Intern | Sonaflex Industries**  
*June 2023 - December 2023*
- Built automated variance and budget-tracking workflows with Excel VBA, SAS PROC SQL, and SAP integrations, reducing month-end reporting by 40%.
- Engineered scalable REST APIs and ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, Databricks, and AWS, enabling seamless automated data ingestion.
- Deployed predictive-maintenance models on IoT/ERP sensor streams with AWS, Docker, and generative-AI augmentation, improving defect-detection accuracy by 25%.

**Data Analyst Intern | Maharashtra State Electricity Board**  
*June 2022 - December 2022*  
- Developed accurate power demand forecasts based on customer usage data, leading to a 15% improvement in operational efficiency.
- Managed financial records, processing transactions including OT bills and travel allowances with high accuracy.

## Research Projects

**Speech-to-Speech Translation using Cascading Connector Architecture**  
*September 2025 - November 2025*
- Built a speech-to-speech translation pipeline combining Whisper ASR, frozen MT, and TTS through a cascading connector for seamless multilingual translation.
- Designed a Q-Former–inspired connector to align ASR embeddings with MT latent spaces, cutting training cost by 90% while preserving high BLEU accuracy.
- Fine-tuned and evaluated the system on multilingual datasets, achieving real-time performance and adaptability comparable to large transformer models.

**BloodBridge - Real-Time Blood Management Web Application**  
*August 2025 - November 2025*
- Built and deployed BloodBridge, a full-stack Flask–PostgreSQL web app with an interactive HTML/CSS/JS front end, reducing emergency blood-response delays by 50%+.
- Designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema with TimescaleDB to manage donors, organizations, inventory, and transactions with real-time traceability.
- Developed responsive, role-based dashboards enabling hospitals and blood banks to monitor inventory and manage operations efficiently.  

**Tesla Stock Price Prediction and Sentiment Analysis**  
*March 2025 - May 2025*
- Built an end-to-end forecasting pipeline combining technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) and Reddit/Guardian/NYT sentiment data, training Random Forest and XGBoost models with walk-forward validation for next-day price forecasts.
- Analyzed feature importance and sentiment impact using SHAP and correlation metrics, visualized through interactive Plotly dashboards for technical and non-technical users.

**Real vs AI-Generated Image Classifier**  
*June 2024 - Decemeber 2024*  
- Developed a deep learning model achieving 92% accuracy in distinguishing real vs. AI-generated images.
- Reduced training time by 70% with optimizations and high GPU performance.

**Credit Risk Assessment Using Machine Learning**  
*January 2024 - May 2024*
- Created and operationalised an end-to-end loan default prediction workflow with preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter
tuning. Assessed multiple models and deployed LightGBM, achieving 77% accuracy with stronger recall on default cases, incorporated
data validation, cross-validation, and imbalanced sampling (SMOTE/undersampling) to ensure reliability across diverse borrower seg-
ments.
- Launched a full-stack credit assessment application using Flask + VueJS, exposing real-time inference APIs and embedding SHAP-based
interpretability with interactive dashboards, delivering transparent, regulator-ready insights for business stakeholders.

**Logistics Management Using Blockchain**  
*July 2023 - December 2023*  
- Created blockchain modules for secure stakeholder interactions using Solidity for smart contracts.
- Enhanced logistics efficiency by 75% through operational transparency and data traceability.
